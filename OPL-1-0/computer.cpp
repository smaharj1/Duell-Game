Function Name: computer
Purpose: Constructor to store the dices of the computer.

Parameters:
	keys, an integer array. It holds the values of the dice that needs to be saved.
	size, an integer. It holds the size of the keys array.

Return Value: none.

Local Variables:
	top, an integer. It holds the top of the dice.
	right, an integer. It holds the right side of the dice.
	front, an integer. It holds the front side of the dice. It is front facing to the player.
	mid, an integer. It holds the middle index of the size.

Algorithm:
	1. Compute the front face from given top and right
	2. Store the Dice in the array of computer's dices.

Function Name: play
Purpose: To play the computers move. It uses an algorithm that suggests the right
	move to make so that the computer can play offensively as well as defensively.

Parameters:
	board, a pointer. It holds the pointer to the board.

Return Value: Returns a dice if computer ate any dice.

Local Variables: 
	suggestedMove, a pointer. It points to the tree node that says which die to move.
	suggestedLocation, a pointer. It points to the location where the die needs to be moved.

Algorithm:
	1. Check if player can move.
	2. If no, check if king is in threat.
	3. If yes, check if threat can be eaten.
	4. If no, check if king can be moved.
	5. If no, then move on to eat other dices of opponent.
	6. If no dices to eat, take an offensive and safe step.
